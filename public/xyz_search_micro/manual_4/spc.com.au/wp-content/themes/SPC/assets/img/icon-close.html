<p>The ‘most satisfied’ rating, voted on by over 1,500 Australian consumers, has compared five of the leading baked beans brands against key indicators of taste, texture and consistency, variety, packaging design, value for money, and overall satisfaction.</p>
<p>Canstar Blue’s first-ever baked beans review has compared SPC against leading competitors Wattie’s, Heinz, ALDI, Woolworths and Coles, with the Australian owned SPC Baked Beans scoring the brand five stars for taste, packaging appeal, texture &amp; consistency, variety and overall satisfaction.</p>
<p>Canstar Blue is a customer satisfaction research and ratings business with the core purpose of helping consumers make better purchase decisions.</p>
<p><strong>SPC Chief Executive Officer, Robert Giles</strong>, said: “We are proud to have received this recognition from Canstar Blue, the leading voice for consumer satisfaction in Australia. Our baked beans have been owned and made in Australia since 1918. This rating reflects SPC’s ongoing commitment to delivering high quality food and drink products that ensure taste, nutrition and value for money for our Australian customers.</p>
<p>“As SPC continues to work on ways to innovate and diversify our product range, we appreciate and celebrate the love Australians have for our iconic Baked Beans range. We will continue to deliver this much loved product at the quality our customers expect, while also exploring new and exciting ways to offer new, tasty, premium food and flavours to Australians.”</p>

<p>This week we announced one of the most unexpected marketing moves yet. Knowing that we&#8217;ll likely be the second most popular choice when it comes to canned food brands, we have launched our range in New Zealand with a campaign to celebrate all things ‘second favourite’.</p>
<p>“You’ll find us next to that more famous guy in the canned food aisle. We’re for anyone who knows what it’s like to be second-pick. Almost the favourite. We’re for Kiwis who don’t need to stand up and beat their chests, but are happy to sit back with something delicious and enjoy,” said Rob Giles, CEO of SPC.</p>
<p>SPC products have been popular across the ditch in Australia for over 100 years with an extensive range of canned foods including baked beans and spaghetti, tinned peaches, pears, fruit salad, apricots, diced tomatoes and crushed tomatoes.</p>
<p>Continued Giles, “We realise there’s more important things in the world than always being first. We’re happy with all the benefits of being slightly less popular, but still really tasty.”</p>
<p>Helping kick-off the launch, we have teamed up with NZ’s second favourite Barrett brother, Jordie Barrett, who knows better than anyone what it’s like to be runner up.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty fun to partner with SPC in celebration of all things second favourite. The past few weeks have also seen some serious game time, so it’s been nice working on a project that’s been a laugh. I don’t like to take myself too seriously and SPC products are no fuss, simple and delicious,” said Barrett.</p>
<p>As part of the campaign, Jordie has released a content series via his Instagram account to celebrate all things second. The four-part video series, which kicks off today, can be viewed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordie_barrett/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our SPC range of sweet and savoury canned products have already started to drop onto supermarket shelves across New Zealand at Foodstuffs and Countdown supermarkets across the North Island, with prices starting at RRP $1.79. Products will be on shelves in the South Island from February 2023.</p>

<p>The partnership comes as SPC looks to inject some fun back into the baked beans aisle!</p>
<p>SPC Marketing Manager George Dimkin says: “Teaming up with VEGEMITE to create the most Australian canned product out there is an exciting milestone in SPC’s long and proud Aussie heritage. We’re expanding the variety of baked beans available which is sure to give Aussies a reason to fall in love with baked beans all over again.</p>

<p>At the tender age of 25 Chris Malone has already enjoyed the kind of career many young chefs only dream of. This Perth-born and raised chef has only been working in the industry for 10 years and already he’s worked at top-notch venues in London, at the very apex of fine dining in Eleven Madison Park New York, and two months ago secured his latest position as Chef de Cuisine of Ossiano restaurant, a stunning underwater fine dining restaurant at Atlantis, The Palm Dubai. We caught up with Chris to find out some of the secrets of his success.</p>
<p>“I was lucky enough to start my apprenticeship at a restaurant called Fraser’s in King Park in Perth and that gave me some amazing foundations – I was surrounded by some incredible, humble and genuine chefs who really cared about the food they produced and they taught me everything they knew,” Chris recalls.</p>
<p>“I think how you start as a young chef can be such a strong influence on your career, and a lot of young chefs aren’t as lucky as I was. The level of care that was instilled into me was remarkable. I think I was pushed in the right direction, but at the same time I wouldn’t be where I am today if I hadn’t had the drive and been willing to take risks. You need to have drive and determination to achieve in any career, and a lot of people don’t want to uproot themselves and leave their everyday lives. Dubai is the fourth country I’ve lived in now and I was ready to take that step and go on that adventure.”</p>
<p>Chris describes his current position as Chef de Cuisine of Ossiano as “one of those once in a lifetime opportunities that comes up and you just have to jump at it. I’m sure my experience at Eleven Madison Park played a role … I think the cuisine style there was a good complement to the direction the management here want to take Ossiano in the future.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4268 aligncenter" src="https://spc.com.au/wp-content/themes/SPC/assets/img/2x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="https://spc.com.au//wp-content/uploads/2021/08/underwater.png" alt="" width="470" height="627" srcset="https://spc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/underwater.png 470w, https://spc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/underwater-75x100.png 75w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4268 aligncenter" src="https://spc.com.au//wp-content/uploads/2021/08/underwater.png" alt="" width="470" height="627" srcset="https://spc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/underwater.png 470w, https://spc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/underwater-75x100.png 75w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></noscript></p>
<p>How Chris got the job was unusual in itself: “I’d never had a LinkedIn bio before and my housemate in London persuaded me to put one up – I had only two LinkedIn connections when I received a message from the VP of Culinary Atlantis which I honestly thought might be some kind of scam. The previous chef here who I took over from is renowned as one of the world’s best so it’s a very serious position.</p>
<p>“I sent a screenshot of the message to my girlfriend and asked if she thought it was for real, and she googled and said, this really is from the VP of Culinary! It was just an expression of interest, I still had to jump through all the hoops to apply, but I thought if you don’t try, you’ll never know – so I went ahead and sent over my CV and portfolio. That was followed by some video calls and psychometric evaluations and now here I am!”</p>
<p>Living and working in Dubai requires considerable adaptation and flexibility, as Chris explains. “Our team is made up of so many different cultures, nationalities and religions – I can’t even count how many different countries Atlantis has drawn its employees from, it would be well over 100. So I’m trying my best to learn about the cultures and the individual idiosyncracies so we can have an efficient workplace.</p>
<p>“It’s an amazing place to work because they look after their staff so well; they’re wanting to achieve the extraordinary so they’re constantly pushing for attention to detail of all the little things. There are 1700 hotel rooms and 22 food outlets within the one complex – Ossiano is just one of many, it’s a massive operation.”</p>
<p>Chris credits the 12 months he spent at Eleven Madison Park, renowned as one of the world’s best restaurants, as imparting invaluable training which stood him in good stead for his current role. “It’s such an inspirational restaurant, they do cuisine that inspires the world – they’re original, creative and and every single thing is so well executed and stunning,” he enthuses. “I had sent them an email and they invited me over to do a <em>stage</em>, so I flew to New York for the world’s most expensive job interview! I did two days and then they offered me a position on a 12 month working visa. I remember I landed in the middle of a snowstorm wearing Perth winter clothes which consisted of a hoodie and some jeans, no thermals!”</p>
<p>Chris says to call working at EMP high pressure would be an understatement, adding: “It wasn’t the hours, which are some of the best I’ve ever done – you did a 10 hour day generally, because they had an am team and a pm team due to the size of the operation. But the amount of <em>mise en place</em> we had to do in a limited time period was insane – everything was made fresh every single day and thrown out at the end, so each day you had to start from scratch.</p>
<p>“We needed to achieve what seemed like an unachievable timeframe – you’d start at one or two in the afternoon and tasting was at 5pm, and take a half hour forced break which virtually gave you three hours to get everything done. So it was extremely challenging, but very rewarding.</p>
<p>“My days of chefs’ competitions really helped prepare me for that, because it’s a similar environment – you’re in an unknown kitchen, you’re completely timed, you have someone watching you and you need to achieve the <em>mise en place</em> in that timeframe. So I was used to high pressure multitasking and I actually enjoyed the pressure of it – you make it a challenge for yourself, see if you can beat your best time by an extra minute or two each day, and if you can it’s a personal achievement. But as soon as you figured out one section they’d move you to another!”</p>
<p>Having secured a sought-after position at Ossiano, Chris is certainly being kept on his toes, but he seems to thrive in these kinds of environments. “I strongly believe success comes down to the individual,” he says. “You need to be extremely driven to achieve in life – you need to want it and dedicate yourself, you need to take a chance. If you dream of doing something, don’t sit on the fence and dwell on it, just do it. It might not work out, but it’s about adapting and doing, and surrounding yourself with the right people. I was lucky enough to find what I love from an early age, which is cooking, and wanting more for myself kept pushing me in the right direction.”</p>

					<h1 class="u-alpha">Ensuring Your Home Delivery Offering Meets Your Customers&#8217; Expectations</h1>
					<div class="c-cms-content">
						<p>Home delivery is a growing channel and is easier than ever to take advantage of – but it’s imperative to make sure your deliveries reach customers in the right condition and temperature and that they’re happy with the overall experience.</p>
<p>While the growing reliance on third party online order platforms and their delivery fleet can make it difficult to control all parts of the process, there are some simple steps you can take to give your food the best chance of meeting your customers’ expectations</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ensure all food on your home delivery menu is ‘fit for purpose’</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Don’t make the mistake of offering food on the home delivery menu which won’t travel well or is too difficult to maintain at the right temperature. Instead, cut back your full menu and focus on those meals which can be efficiently prepared and packaged, which will withstand the rigorous of transport and which work well as take home choices.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Give the customer enough information to make an informed choice</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Make sure your menu descriptors provide a clear overview of exactly what the customer’s ordering with particular regard to any food allergens or ingredients which can provoke food intolerance, such as gluten, lactose, nuts and so on. At the same time, be wary of making claims which cannot be substantiated – for example, you can’t label a meal as gluten free unless it contains no detectable gluten, which is virtually impossible to achieve if it’s prepared in a kitchen where gluten is readily present in other ingredients (wheat and its derivatives, rye, barley and oats) due to the likelihood of cross-contamination.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Use appropriate packaging and choose it carefully</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The packaging you choose not only has to insulate properly &#8211; keeping hot food hot and cold food cold – it also needs to keep the food safe and hygienic. Tamper-proof safety seals were virtually unheard of on home delivery food packaging prior to Covid but in these days of lockdowns have quickly become the norm. They feature security seals which are difficult to remove without damaging the packaging – so when customers see their packaging is undamaged, it reassures them that their order hasn’t been tampered with. Tamper-proof packaging costs a little more but it’s worth the extra to protect your business brand.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Give customers the option of contactless payment</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">With people seeking to minimise unnecessary close contact, it’s helpful to provide customers contactless payment options. Mobile payment options such as Apple Pay or PayPal are a good choice, and a payment checkout that’s directly integrated within your mobile order app so customers can complete their order seamlessly is even better. The aim should always be to minimise the steps necessary for the customer to make the order while maximising convenience.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Ensure your delivery staff keep their distance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Following on from the last point, you should also instruct staff to avoid contact with customers, such as by ringing their doorbell but leaving the food on the doorstep for the customer first. If your order system allows for it, it’s best to advise customers of what your procedure is in this regard, so they know what to expect and what role they need to play in the process – which will help to keep everybody safe.</p>

					<h1 class="u-alpha">The Benefits of Choosing Local Produce &#8211; and Why It Resonates With Your Millennial Customers</h1>
					<div class="c-cms-content">
						<p>How your food is prepared and where your ingredients come from are two areas that today’s consumers are increasingly curious about.</p>
<p>Research shows that millennials in particular – that is, people born between 1980 and 2000, which comprises a big chunk of your potential customers – are highly aware of and concerned about issues around food provenance and environmental sustainability, as <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2018/the-education-of-the-sustainable-mindset/">this recent Nielsen report shows</a></p>
<p>If your customers are asking about provenance, food miles and related issues, it shows they’re looking to support businesses which are committed to Australian sourced produce. By choosing ingredients which have travelled fewer food miles, you’ll be seen as making as a positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Nielsen’s research also shows millennials actively seek out those foodservice businesses which are supporting local producers and farmers as opposed to choosing imported product.</p>
<p>This is why choosing fruit from a local producer like SPC makes sound business sense. As Australia’s largest packaged processed fruit and vegetable manufacturer, SPC makes a substantial economic contribution to the Goulburn Valley region, which is where some 97 per cent of its fruit is grown. By choosing quality local produce such as SPC’s over imported, you’re helping to make the local economy stronger, which is good for all Australian businesses.</p>
<p>And as it’s one of Australia’s most fertile areas with great sunlight and irrigation, SPC fruit from the Goulburn Valley beats imported product hands-down. It’s nurtured and grown on long-established fruits, such as pear trees some 60 to 80 years old, then hand-picked and handled with care, with all SPCs growers certified by a rigorous independently audited environmental assurance program.</p>
<p>SPC also has full traceability on all its fruit, so it can be tracked back to the farm of origin – the quality assurance that goes into each pack of SPC fruit is second to none. And because SPC fruit is processed and packaged in close proximity to the farms on which it’s grown, the food miles it takes to reach you are lower than imported product – which means lower environmental impact from transport fuel and associated factors which can impact on longterm sustainability.</p>
<p>And thanks to SPC’s expert processing and packaging, this great quality Australian fruit is available all year-round – so you don’t need to worry about seasonal shortages impacting your menu.</p>
<p>The quality locally produced fruit from SPC includes Tatura Peaches, with their consistently delicious flavour and firm body making them ideal for desserts as well as in savoury dishes to accompany red and white meats; juicy Apricots which are the perfect choice for classic dishes like Apricot Chicken and in jams and chutneys as well as desserts; Pears which can be served poached, infused and pickled;  and vine-ripened Tomatoes which are a staple of winter dishes and an essential ingredient in many cuisine styles.</p>
<p>So try the SPC fruit difference for yourself – and build greater engagement with your customers through your use of superior quality Australian produce!</p>
